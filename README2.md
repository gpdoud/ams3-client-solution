7/11/2018 - Notes from Bobbi:

* For printing assets, Bobbi needs to tell me:
  * What fields on each line (may be two lines)
  * What selection options are required
  * What sort options are required.

* Need a new department table

* Every asset will be assigned to a department

* Users are assigned a department

* Some departments (Sherrif) assigns vehicles to users (FK to user table) only in that department (drop-down list to show only users in the same department)

* Currently, no use for Address (probably keep the table for future use)

* To sort lists, click on a column heading
  * Be able to click on Year/Make/Model separately to sort
  * She'll think about default sorts for lists

* Categories apply to all assets
  * Includes which asset class the category CAN be attached to. (FK optional)

* (Future) Property asset
  * Needs the insurance fields (value)
